# MusicMap

### About the project
During my sophomore year's first semester, my colleague and I collaboratively built musicmap, which was my first dive into website development. For our final project that semester, we seamlessly merged our love for music and geography to build a platform showcasing the top artists and songs from nearly every country on the map. Moreover, the website features engaging trivia quizzes designed to test and enhance your musical knowledge.
